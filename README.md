# critical_barrier_width
Code to find the critical barrier width for coastal overwash, see Chen et al. (2019)


Critical barrier width can be obtained from two scripts, (1) first a javascript within the Google Earth Engine interface, next (2) postprocessing in Matlab.

1. Google Earth Engine scripts:
This script generates a kml file of yearly barrier island outlines from 1984 to 2018.

2. Matlab scripts:
In this script you can import a kml file to generate a barrier overwash vs. barrier width plot
